## **Usage**  

### **Start the Server**
```bash
cd server/api
python app.py
```

### **Run the Drone Simulation**  
From the projectâ€™s root directory, start the Python simulation:

```bash  
python drone_simulation2.py  
```  

### **Run the Frontend**
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the React development server:  
```bash  
cd frontend
npm start  
```  
The app will run at `http://localhost:3000`.  

### **Run the admin frontend
Navigate to the `admin-frontend` directory and start the React development server:  
```bash  
cd admin-frontend
npm start
```  
The app will run at `http://localhost:3000`, unless you are already running the user frontend. In that case another port will be picked. Check the terminal output to see the port number.
